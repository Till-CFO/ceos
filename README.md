# CEOS

**Run EOS with AI.** CEOS brings the [Entrepreneurial Operating System](https://www.eosworldwide.com/) to [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), giving your leadership team seven AI-powered skills for Vision, Rocks, Scorecard, L10 Meetings, IDS, Process, and People Analyzer.

Clone. Setup. Run your business.

## What is CEOS?

CEOS (Claude + EOS) is a Claude Code skills package that implements the core EOS tools as AI-assisted workflows. Your EOS data lives as markdown files in your repo — human-readable, GitHub-renderable, and git-diffable. No database, no SaaS subscription, no vendor lock-in.

**Designed for CEOs and leadership teams**, not developers. If you can run `git clone` and `./setup.sh`, you're ready.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone (or fork for your company)
git clone https://github.com/bradfeld/ceos.git
cd ceos

# 2. Install skills + initialize your company data
./setup.sh init

# 3. Start using EOS in any Claude Code session

## The 7 Skills

| Skill | What It Does | Try Saying... |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **ceos-vto** | Vision/Traction Organizer — your company's strategic document | "Review our vision" or "Update our 10-year target" |
| **ceos-rocks** | Quarterly Rocks — 90-day priorities with owners and outcomes | "Set rocks for Q1" or "How are our rocks tracking?" |
| **ceos-scorecard** | Weekly Measurables — track the 5-15 numbers that matter | "Log this week's scorecard" or "Show scorecard trends" |
| **ceos-l10** | Level 10 Meetings — structured weekly leadership meetings | "Run our L10" or "Start our weekly meeting" |
| **ceos-ids** | Identify, Discuss, Solve — structured issue resolution | "We have an issue" or "IDS this problem" |
| **ceos-process** | Core Processes — document, simplify, and track followability | "Document our sales process" or "Audit process FBA scores" |
| **ceos-people** | People Analyzer — right people, right seats (Core Values + GWC) | "Evaluate Brad" or "Quarterly people review" |

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  skills/ceos-*/SKILL.md         │  ← Claude Code skills (7 EOS tools)
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  data/ + templates/             │  ← Your EOS data (markdown files)
│  (markdown + YAML frontmatter)  │     Human-readable, git-tracked
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  setup.sh                       │  ← One-command installer
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Three layers:**

- **Upstream** (`bradfeld/ceos`) — Skills, templates, docs. No company data.
- **Your fork** (`your-company/ceos`) — Your team's EOS data in `data/`.
- **Personal config** (`.ceos-user.yaml`, gitignored) — Per-person preferences.

## Data Format

All EOS data is stored as markdown with YAML frontmatter. Example Rock:

```markdown
---
id: rock-001
title: Launch Beta Program
owner: brad
quarter: 2026-Q1
status: on_track
created: 2026-01-02
due: 2026-03-31
---

## Measurable Outcome

Beta program launched with 10+ users actively providing feedback.

## Milestones

- [ ] Beta invitation system built
- [ ] First 10 users onboarded
- [ ] Feedback collection process established
```

Everything is a file. Git history is your audit trail.

## For Teams

CEOS is built for multi-person leadership teams:

1. **Fork** this repo to your company's GitHub
2. Run `./setup.sh init` — each team member does this once
3. **Commit data** to your fork — git is the collaboration layer
4. **Pull upstream** for skill updates — your data stays untouched

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
- Git
- That's it. No Node.js, no Python, no Docker.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from both EOS practitioners and developers. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
